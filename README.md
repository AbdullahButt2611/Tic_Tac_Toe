<p align="justify">
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns marking a 3x3 grid with their symbol, either X or O. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.
To play the game, simply click on the box in the grid where you want to place your symbol. The game will alternate between X and O symbols for each player's turn. If a player gets three of their symbols in a row, they win the game. If all nine squares on the grid are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
<br><br>
The interface of our tic tac toe game is simple and user-friendly. The game board is displayed prominently in the center of the screen, with each square of the grid clearly marked and easy to click on. At the top of the screen, there is a button to start a new game whenever the user wants to play again.
In addition to the game board, there are also visual indicators to show whose turn it is and who has won the game. When it is a player's turn, their symbol will be highlighted at the top of the screen. If a player wins the game, a message will be displayed on the screen declaring them the winner. If the game ends in a draw, a message will be displayed stating that the game is a draw.
We hope you enjoy playing our tic tac toe game and have fun competing against your friends and family!
